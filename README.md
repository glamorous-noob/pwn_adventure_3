### Who is glamorous_noob? 

I am glamorous_noob. I am a noob who is glamorous.

Although I am studying computer science and cybersecurity in a university, I am mainly self-taught when it comes to RE (Reverse Engineering). I had a couple of classes about it in university and some workshops organized by my then-senpais, but I mostly self-taught through cracking challenges on root-me.org.

I know there are many other glamorous noobs in existence, but I called the title first. HAH!

***NB :*** *If glamorous_noob decides to speak about themselves in 3rd person (sorta happens sometimes, like in this sentence), they will use the pronoun "they" (also like in this sentence) because glamorous_noob is a fan of Nathan Pyle's Strange Planet comics.*

### What is PwnAdventure3?

Basically it's a game made to be hacked. For more info, here's a link: https://www.pwnadventure.com/

### What happens when glamorous_noob meets PwnAdventure3?

They do a silly write-up about it apparently. 

I first knew about the game from a friend in class, and then I found out about LiveOverflow's series on YouTube about the game. I watched only the first part of the first video and then decided not to spoil anymore of the game and try to do it myself.

By documenting (parts of) *My Glamorous Noobness's* journey, I wish to help other noobs (potentially equally glamorous as myself) with their own journeys, and also learn from them through their feedback.
I also think it will be overall fun to look back at this, many years from now, and think "pfsh, noob", like I've already done a couple of times so far.

Also, this is the first time I'll be reverse-engineering something that's not a *catch-the-flag* kind of executable. So PwnAdventure3 will be a big leap out of my comfort zone in many ways.

Last but not least, this is purely for training. What I'm doing in this project isn't how one would actually hack a video game IRL. Using CheatEngine for example is way faster than statically analyzing everything.

### *<u>PLEASE BE ADVISED OF THE FOLLOWING:</u>*

- Here be strong language (maybe, I don't know, I still haven't written anything). At your risk and peril.
- This documentation is not meant to be a tutorial, really, and it will skip over most of the boring bits.
- There are probably better tutorials and write-ups elsewhere (like LiveOverflow's one which I still haven't watched), but I still want to document how I did
- I am a non-native English speaker. Just ignore language mistakes unless the sentence really doesn't make any sense. In which case, please do inform glamorous_noob. (Thank you!)
- As a glamorous noob, I would be happy to get useful RE tips, may it be to improve the reliability, the elegancy, or the speed of my solutions.

### Progress made

As you'll see if you read the first episode, I decided to work locally first. All of the episodes made so far are about local patches. No server side yet.
I was half-way through the 8th and last episode about static analysis when my hard drive malfunctioned. I no longer have the Ghidra project. In accordnance with my laziness policy, I will abandon this. 

What next?

- Maybe do stuff with CheatEngine?
- Maybe learn how to create my own trainers and automate what I would do with CheatEngine?
- Maybe setup a Pwn Adventure server and try to do the server-side hacks?

I don't know. I will wait for motivation and inspiration.

#### Client-side hacks

I mostly do static analysis. No dynamic analysis. Sometimes though I'll use a debugger when I need to debug my own patches (which I'll mention in the corresponding episode).

- **Episode 1:** Discovering the game
- **Episode 2:** Getting played by my laziness & Ghidra
- **Episode 3:** Infinite mana
- **Episode 4:** Infinite health
- **Episode 5:** Free stuff in shops
- **Episode 6:** Unsuccessful attempt at getting rich fast
- **Episode 7:** Infinite money

#### Server-side hacks

Should be here any minute now. Just, try refreshing your browser. And restart your computer. A LOT. At least 5 times a day. Computers love that shit.
