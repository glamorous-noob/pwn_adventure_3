### Who is glamorous_noob? 

I am glamorous_noob. I am a noob who is glamorous.

Although I am studying computer science and cybersecurity in a university, I am mainly self-taught when it comes to RE (Reverse Engineering). I had a couple of classes about it in university and some workshops organized by my then-senpais, but I mostly self-taught through cracking challenges on root-me.org.

I know there are many other glamorous noobs in existence, but I called the title first. HAH!

***NB :*** *If glamorous_noob decides to speak about themselves in 3rd person (sorta happens sometimes, like in this sentence), they will use the pronoun "they" (also like in this sentence) because glamorous_noob is a fan of Nathan Pyle's Strange Planet comics.*

### What is PwnAdventure3?

Basically it's a game made to be hacked. For more info, here's a link: https://www.pwnadventure.com/

### What happens when glamorous_noob meets PwnAdventure3?

They do a silly write-up about it apparently. 

I first knew about the game from a friend in class, and then I found out LiveOverflow's series on YouTube about the game. I watched only the first part of the first video and then decided not to spoil anymore of the game and try to do it myself.

By documenting (parts of) *My Glamorous Noobness's* journey, I wish to help other noobs (potentially equally glamorous as myself) with their own journeys, and also learn from them through their feedback.
I also think it will be overall fun to look back at this, many years from now, and think "pfsh, noob", like I've already done a couple of times so far.

Also, this is the first time I'll be reverse-engineering something that's not a *catch-the-flag* kind of executable. So PwnAdventure3 will be a big leap out of my comfort zone in many ways.

### *<u>PLEASE BE ADVISED OF THE FOLLOWING:</u>*

- Here be strong language (maybe, I don't know, I still haven't wrote anything). At your risk and peril.
- This documentation is not meant to be a tutorial, really, and it will skip over most of the boring bits.
- There are probably better tutorials and write-ups elsewhere (like LiveOverflow's one which I still haven't watched), but I still want to document how I did
- I am a non-native English speaker. Just ignore language mistakes unless the sentence really doesn't make any sense. In which case, please do inform glamorous_noob. (Thank you!)
- As a glamorous noob, I would be happy to get useful RE tips, may it be to improve the reliability, the elegancy, or the speed of my solutions.
